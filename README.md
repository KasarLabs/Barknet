## ðŸ“£ Building App Chains

> Do NOT fork this repo and build your app chain on top unless completely
> necessary. By adding changes using forking, you will have to periodically
> rebase (and solve conflicts) to remain updated with the latest version of
> Madara.

One of the main features of Madara is to allow users to start their app chains
that support Cairo contracts and Starknet like blocks. Hence, to make it easy
for users to build a custom app chain, we have created an
[app-chain-template](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara-app-chain-template)
which imports Madara as a pallet. This removes all the boilerplate code and
allows you to focus on code only relevant to your app chain. Moreover, updating
Madara is as simple as updating the pallet version.
